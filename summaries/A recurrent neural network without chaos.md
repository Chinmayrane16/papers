### General comments on paper quality:
- Quite well-written and somewhat interesting paper.

### Comments:
- I note that their LSTM implementation consistently outperformed their proposed CFN, albeit with a small margin.

- Would be interesting to know if this architecture has been studied further since the release of this paper, can it match LSTM performance also on more complicated tasks?
