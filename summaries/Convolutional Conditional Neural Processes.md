### General comments on paper quality:
- Quite interesting and well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Took me a pretty long time to read this paper, it is a quite heavy/dense read.

- I still do not quite get when this type of model could/should be used in practice, all experiments in the paper seem at least somewhat synthetic to me.
