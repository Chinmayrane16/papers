### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and quite interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Obviously similar to "Uncertainty Decomposition in Bayesian Neural Networks with Latent Variables", but contains more details, further experiments, and does a better job explaining some of the core concepts.
