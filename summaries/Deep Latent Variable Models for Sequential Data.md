### General comments on paper quality:
- Very well-written, VERY useful.

### Comments:
- VERY good general introduction to latent variable models, amortized variational inference, VAEs etc.

- VERY good introduction to various deep latent variable models for sequential data: deep state-space models, VAE-RNNs, VRNNs, SRNNs etc.
