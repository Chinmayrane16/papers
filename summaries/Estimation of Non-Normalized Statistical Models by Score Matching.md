### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting and very well-written paper.

### Comments:
- The original paper for score matching. Somewhat dated of course, but still interesting and very well-written. It provides a really neat introduction to score matching!

- I did not read section 3 super carefully, as the examples seemed quite dated.
