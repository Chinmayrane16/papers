### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting, but not overly well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Very similar to "Learning Non-Convergent Non-Persistent Short-Run MCMC Toward Energy-Based Model", but not as clearly written IMO.

- I personally find the experiments section somewhat unclear, but I'm also not too familiar with how generative image models usually are evaluated.

- It sounds like the training was quite unstable without the regularization described in section 3.3?
