### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting and very well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Does a very good job introducing the general problem setup, normalizing flows, autoregressive models etc. Definitely a good introductory paper,  it straightened out a few things I found confusing in [Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows](https://github.com/fregu856/papers/blob/master/summaries/Variational%20Inference%20with%20Normalizing%20Flows.md).

- The experimental results are however not very strong nor particularly extensive, IMO.
