### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Seeing the non-convergent, short-run MCMC as a learned generator/flow model is a really neat and interesting idea. I find figure 9 in the appendix interesting. 

- It is somewhat difficult for me to judge how impressive the experimental results are, I do not really know how strong the baselines are or how significant the improvements are.

- I found section 4 difficult to follow.
