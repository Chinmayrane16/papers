### General comments on paper quality:
- Quite interesting and well-written paper. Quite an easy read compared to many other SG-MCMC papers.

### Comments:
- I find it weird that they only evaluate their models in terms of accuracy. It is of course a good thing that SG-MCMC methods seem to compare favorably with optimization approaches, but I would have been more interested in an evaluation of some kind of uncertainty estimate (e.g. the sample variance). 

- The studied applications are not overly interesting, the paper seems somewhat dated in that regard.
