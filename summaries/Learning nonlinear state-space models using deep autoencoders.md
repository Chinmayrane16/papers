### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Really interesting approach actually, although somewhat confusing at first read since the method seems to involve quite a few different components.

- I would like to try to implement this myself and apply it to some simple synthetic example, I think that would significantly improve my understanding of the method and help me better judge its potential.
