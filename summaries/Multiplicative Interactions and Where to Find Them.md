### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and somewhat interesting paper.

### Comments:
- I had some trouble properly understanding everything.

- I am however not overly impressed by the choice of experiments. 

- The experiment in figure 2 seems somewhat biased in their favor.  I think it would be a more fair comparison if the number of layers in the MLP was allowed to be increased (since this would increase its expressivity)?
