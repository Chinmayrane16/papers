### General comments on paper quality:
- Somewhat interesting and well-written paper.

### Comments:
- Quite theoretical paper with a bunch of proofs, it is not exactly the type of paper I was looking for.

- Interesting to see NCE applied specifically to supervised problems (modelling p(y | x)), but I am not sure how much I actually learned by reading this paper.
