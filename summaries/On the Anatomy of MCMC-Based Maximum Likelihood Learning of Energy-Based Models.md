### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and very interesting paper, a recommended read!

### Comments:
- Provides a good review and categorization of previous papers, how they differ from each other etc.

- Provides a solid theoretical understanding of MCMC-based ML learning of EBMs, with quite a few really interesting (and seemingly useful) insights.
