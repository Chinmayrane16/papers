### General comments on paper quality:
Reasonably well-written and somewhat interesting paper.

### Comments:
The paper seems quite dated compared to [_"Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks"_](https://github.com/fregu856/papers/blob/master/summaries/Weight%20Uncertainty%20in%20Neural%20Networks.md)
