### General comments on paper quality:
- Quite well-written and interesting paper.

### Comments:
- The toy problems illustrated in figure 2 and figure 3 are quite neat. I did however find it quite odd that they did not actually perform any active learning experiments here?

- Figure 4b is quite confusing with the "insert" for beta=0. I think it would have been better to show this entire figure somehow.
