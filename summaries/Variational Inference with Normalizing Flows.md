### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and quite interesting paper.


### Comments:
- I was initially somewhat confused by this paper, as I was expecting it to deal with variational inference for approximate Bayesian inference.

- Seems like a good starting point for flow-based methods, I will continue reading-up on more recent/advanced techniques.
