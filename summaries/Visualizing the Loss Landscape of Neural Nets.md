### General comments on paper quality:
- Interesting and quite well-written paper.

### Comments:
- I think that the paper is a good introduction to methods for NN loss function visualization and previous work aiming to understand the corresponding optimization problem. They cite a number of papers which seem interesting, I will probably try and read a couple of those in the future.

- It would be interesting to apply their visualization method to some of my own  problems, I will probably look more carefully at their code at some point. It is however not immediately obvious to me how to apply their "filter normalization" to e.g. an MLP network.
